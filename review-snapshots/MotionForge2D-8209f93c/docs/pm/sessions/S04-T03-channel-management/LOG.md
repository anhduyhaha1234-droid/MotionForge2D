# Execution Log — Task S04-T03

- [2026-08-04T11:47:00+07:00] S04-T03 session packet created. Initiated Channel Management UI execution.
- [2026-08-04T12:06:50+07:00] Baseline (protocol §3):
  - `git status --short` → `M channels.json` (user-modified, ~229 extra rows — PROTECTED, never overwrite), `?? data/`, `?? docs/pm/sessions/S04-T03-channel-management/`
  - Registered durable channel routes (`python -c` router print): GET/POST `/api/channels`, GET/PATCH `/api/channels/{id}`, POST `/api/channels/{id}/archive`, GET `/api/channels/roles`, GET `/api/channels/statuses`. NO `/api/v2/channels` mount exists.
  - `ChannelRole` enum (app/schemas/__init__.py:282) = SOURCE/PRODUCTION only; `grep -rn "\"both\"" app/ docs/pm docs/architecture` → 0 matches.
  - Approved contract S03-T01 AC2 (docs/architecture/CHANNEL_API.md §3): "role is exactly source or production (schema CHECK + DTO enum)".
  - Task write scope (START_PROMPT): `frontend/src/app/(app)/channels/page.tsx` only — backend/contract is forbidden scope.
- [2026-08-04T12:06:50+07:00] CONFLICT DETECTED (protocol §3.5 stop condition): task requires role selection/badge `(source, production, both)` and URL `/api/v2/channels`; approved backend contract supports ONLY roles source|production at `/api/channels`. Adding `both` requires modifying an APPROVED contract (ChannelRole enum, CHANNEL_ROLES CHECK, migration, tests) — outside allowed write scope. → REPORT.md set to BLOCKED; ONE minimal question asked.
