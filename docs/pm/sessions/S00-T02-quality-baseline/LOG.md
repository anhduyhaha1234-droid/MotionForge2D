# S00-T02 Session Log — Quality Baseline Runner

Session: `docs/pm/sessions/S00-T02-quality-baseline`
Task: Reproducible quality baseline runner
Status: IN PROGRESS

## 2026-08-03 — Baseline inventory

### Required reading completed
- [x] `docs/pm/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`
- [x] `docs/pm/sessions/S00-T02-quality-baseline/TASK.md`
- [x] `pyproject.toml` — pytest markers (integration/gpu/sam2/slow), ruff config (E/F/I/N/W/UP/B/SIM/TCH, line-length 100), mypy strict
- [x] `frontend/package.json` — scripts: build=`next build`, lint=`eslint`, dev/start; deps Next 16.2.12, React 19.2.4, TS ^5
- [x] `.gitignore` — root already ignores `output/`, `output_m05/`, `projects/`, `*.log`, caches
- [x] `frontend/.gitignore` — ignores `/node_modules`, `/.next/`, `/out/`, `/build`, `*.tsbuildinfo`
- [x] `frontend/AGENTS.md` — Next.js 16 breaking-changes notice; local docs in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`
- [x] Local Next.js docs (required by frontend/AGENTS.md): `01-getting-started/01-installation.md` — `next build` builds for production; Next 16 `next build` no longer runs linter automatically (lint must be run via npm scripts); Turbopack is default bundler

### Optional evidence used
- [x] `docs/pm/sessions/S00-T01-baseline-isolation/REPORT.md` — latest Python baseline: `141 passed, 6 skipped, 7 deselected, 14 warnings` (full non-GPU)
- [x] `frontend/README.md` — no extra gate commands documented (Next default scaffold)
- [x] `frontend/package-lock.json` — npm lockfile present

### Pre-existing user changes (PROTECT — do not overwrite)
Same set as S00-T01 (unchanged since):
- `M app/services/preset_manager.py`, `M app/workflow/channel_service.py` (S00-T01 DI), `M tests/test_channel_workspace.py`, `M tests/test_preset_manager.py`
- `M channels.json` (pre-existing pollution; forbidden to touch)
- `?? docs/…`, `?? presets/characters/dan_choi_*.png` (6 untracked assets)

### Preflight tool versions (recorded for baseline)
```
python --version  → Python 3.11.9
node --version    → v26.4.0
npm --version     → 11.17.0
frontend deps     → node_modules present; tsc/eslint/next binaries OK
```

### Baseline git status

```

### Plan (7 steps)
1. Write `scripts/quality-baseline.ps1` — 7 gates, per-gate capture (command/stdout/stderr/exit code/duration/status/log path), continue-on-fail, summary JSON + logs under `output/quality-baseline/`, exit code = 0 only if all required gates pass, repo root derived from script location, no absolute machine paths in tracked docs, no env dump/secrets.
2. Add `.gitignore` rule for `output/quality-baseline/` (generated artifacts) if not already covered.
3. Syntax-check the script; run once from repo root; verify all 7 gates recorded, artifacts exist.
4. Run from a different cwd (AC1) to prove repo-root resolution.
5. Run required validation: two full runs capturing `$LASTEXITCODE`; verify both reports contain 7 gates; check `output/quality-baseline` contents.
6. Write `docs/quality/QUALITY_BASELINE.md` with exact results, versions, known failures/warnings, re-run instructions.
7. Fill `REPORT.md` → `SUBMITTED`, evidence AC1–AC7; append LOG.md; stop for PM review.


## 2026-08-03 - Implementation and validation (append)

### Changes made (allowed scope only)
1. scripts/quality-baseline.ps1 - NEW PowerShell runner (PS 5.1 compatible):
   - Repo root resolved from script location (Split-Path -Parent MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path), independent of cwd.
   - 7 gates run sequentially; per-gate capture of command/stdout/stderr/exit code/duration/status/log path.
   - Continue-on-fail: a failing gate never blocks later gates.
   - Statuses: PASS / FAIL / SKIPPED-PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED; overall exit 0 only if all required gates pass, 1 on any FAIL, 2 on preflight block.
   - Output: output/quality-baseline/<run-id>/ with per-gate .log + .err.log + summary.json (UTF-8 no BOM).
   - Uses absolute paths for npm.cmd/npx.cmd (ProcessStartInfo + relative .cmd name fails on Windows); no env dump, no secrets, no absolute machine paths in tracked docs.
2. .gitignore - added output/quality-baseline/ under Output section.

### Debugging notes (fixed during development - recorded for transparency)
- PS 5.1: ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList does NOT exist - switched to psi.Arguments string with manual quoting helper ConvertTo-ArgumentString.
- PS 5.1: -and at end of line then continuation fails - backtick-continuation with operator at start of next line.
- PS 5.1: parameter named Args collides with the automatic variable - renamed to ArgList (arguments were silently dropped).
- Windows: npm/npx resolve via npm.cmd/npx.cmd; relative .cmd name fails under ProcessStartInfo - use (Get-Command npm.cmd).Source absolute path.
- PS 5.1 Set-Content -Encoding utf8 writes BOM - JSON written via [System.IO.File]::WriteAllText with UTF8Encoding(false).
- Deadlock risk: stdout/stderr read synchronously in sequence - both read via ReadToEndAsync() before WaitForExit.

### Required validation - run 1 (no pipe; LASTEXITCODE captured directly)
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/quality-baseline.ps1  -> run id 20260803-120140
firstExit = 1   (EXPECTED: baseline contains known failures)

Gate 1 - Environment/Preflight   PASS   exit=0   0s
Gate 2 - Python tests            PASS   exit=0   13.94s
Gate 3 - Python lint             PASS   exit=0   0.06s
Gate 4 - Python typing           FAIL   exit=1   0.51s   (123 mypy errors - baseline)
Gate 5 - Frontend typecheck      PASS   exit=0   1.55s
Gate 6 - Frontend lint           FAIL   exit=1   3.10s   (eslint errors - baseline)
Gate 7 - Frontend build          PASS   exit=0   5.34s
OVERALL: FAIL (exit code 1)

### Required validation - run 2
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/quality-baseline.ps1  -> run id 20260803-120105
secondExit = 1   (EXPECTED)

Gate 1 - Environment/Preflight   PASS   exit=0   0s
Gate 2 - Python tests            PASS   exit=0   13.87s
Gate 3 - Python lint             PASS   exit=0   0.06s
Gate 4 - Python typing           FAIL   exit=1   0.53s
Gate 5 - Frontend typecheck      PASS   exit=0   1.54s
Gate 6 - Frontend lint           FAIL   exit=1   3.06s
Gate 7 - Frontend build          PASS   exit=0   5.39s
OVERALL: FAIL (exit code 1)

### AC1 check - run from a different cwd
cd C:/Users/Admin (NOT repo root); run script with absolute path.
repo root detected: C:/Users/Admin/MotionForge2D -> run id 20260803-120225, all 7 gates present.

### Artifacts
Get-ChildItem output/quality-baseline -Recurse -> <run-id>/summary.json, gate1_preflight.log, Gate_N_*.log + .err.log per gate (7 gates in every official run; JSON valid, UTF-8 no BOM).
git check-ignore output/quality-baseline/20260803-120105/summary.json -> IGNORED OK (AC4)

### git diff --check / status
git diff --check  -> exit=0 (only CRLF warnings)
git status --short:

Production source/data untouched by S00-T02.

### Known baseline failures (data - NOT fixed, per task)
- Gate 4 (mypy): 123 errors / 16 files - e.g. projects.py ReplacementConfig mode/asset_path typing, app.py:36 dict type-arg.
- Gate 6 (eslint): no-require-imports (e2e specs), react/no-unescaped-entities (AssemblyModal.tsx), setState-in-effect (CompositeCanvas.tsx), unused-var warnings.


## 2026-08-03 - CORRECTION (PM review CHANGES_REQUESTED round 2)

### PM review findings (addressed)
1. docs/quality/QUALITY_BASELINE.md run-1 ID corrected: 20260803-120028 -> 20260803-120140,
   with exact metrics read from the official artifact output/quality-baseline/20260803-120140/summary.json:
   Gate2 14.38s, Gate4 0.52s, Gate6 3.12s, all other gates unchanged.
2. Sentence corrected from 'all seven gates always execute' to:
   'all seven gates are always recorded; runnable gates execute, while preflight-blocked
   gates are recorded as SKIPPED/PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED.' (QUALITY_BASELINE.md and REPORT.md).
3. REPORT.md checked for the same contradiction: no remaining 120028 references in tracked
   docs except PM_REVIEW.md itself (untouched per scope); continue-on-fail wording updated to match.
4. No runner re-run needed (documentation-only correction). No script/source/dependency changes.

### Verification after correction
git diff --check -> exit=0 (only CRLF warnings)
git status --short -> only task docs changed (QUALITY_BASELINE.md, REPORT.md, LOG.md) plus
pre-existing S00-T01/user changes; no new files.


## 2026-08-03 - CORRECTION round 3 (PM review CHANGES_REQUESTED)

### PM review findings (addressed)
REPORT.md Run 1 table (20260803-120140) still showed durations 13.94s / 3.10s
instead of the official artifact values 14.38s / 3.12s.

### Changes made (REPORT.md only)
1. Run 1 - Python tests duration: 13.94s -> 14.38s (artifact 20260803-120140).
2. Run 1 - Frontend lint duration: 3.10s -> 3.12s (artifact 20260803-120140).
3. Also corrected Run 1 - Python typing duration 0.51s -> 0.52s to fully match
   the official artifact (PM requirement: no duration may contradict it).
4. Verified programmatically: Run 1 table now matches
   output/quality-baseline/20260803-120140/summary.json for all 7 gates
   (0s, 14.38s, 0.06s, 0.52s, 1.55s, 3.12s, 5.34s); no stale 13.94/3.10 remain.
5. Run 2 table (20260803-120105) left unchanged - matches its own artifact
   (13.87s / 0.53s / 3.06s).

### Verification after correction
git diff --check -> exit=0 (only CRLF warnings)
git status --short -> only REPORT.md changed in this round (plus pre-existing
S00-T01/user changes and earlier S00-T02 files); no new files.
