# S02-T04 - Restart reconciliation and safe resume

**Status:** READY
**Epic:** E01 - Durable Domain, Persistence and Jobs
**Sprint:** S02 - Durable processing
**Gate:** G1 - Foundation green
**Depends on:** S02-T03 (APPROVED)

## User outcome

After a forced worker/application close, expired in-flight Jobs are fenced and
either resume safely from durable checkpoints or fail with an actionable stable
error; stale workers can never publish afterward.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC1 Explicit run-once/startup reconciler scans only expired active leases
      using bounded batches; no import-time execution.
- [ ] AC2 Reconciliation atomically invalidates old fence token and records
      `running|cancelling -> fenced -> queued|failed` events.
- [ ] AC3 Retryable Jobs with attempts remaining and valid versioned checkpoint
      requeue/resume; incompatible/missing-required checkpoint fails closed.
- [ ] AC4 Cancelling Jobs reconcile to cancelled without running new effects;
      exhausted/permanent/input-changed Jobs fail with stable envelope.
- [ ] AC5 Old worker token is rejected after reconciliation and cannot mutate or
      publish; new worker continues from committed checkpoint without duplicates.
- [ ] AC6 Forced-close/reopen integration tests prove state/events/attempts and
      artifact visibility across fresh engine/session instances.
- [ ] AC7 No API cutover/schema/deps; targeted tests and 7/7 PASS.
