"""Project summary read model (S03-T04) — live, durable, read-only.

This module implements the approved read-model contract of
``docs/pm/sessions/S03-T04-project-summary/TASK.md`` on the S01/S02
durable tables.  Design rules enforced here:

- **No persistence of aggregates.**  ``SummaryRepository`` derives every
  value live from durable rows inside ONE consistent read boundary (a
  single caller-owned Session; the service commits nothing because reads
  only).  There is no cache, no aggregate table, no migration, and no
  filesystem/JSON write.
- **One shared algorithm.**  ``summarize_one`` and ``list_summaries``
  both call the same ``_compose`` batch composer so the collection and
  item routes can never disagree (AC9, CORRECTION P1.1).  The composer
  performs a CONSTANT number of SQL queries for a page — independent of
  page size and of the total number of Projects:
    1. one page-select of ``project`` rows (ordered by the
       authoritative global activity key, ``last_activity DESC, id
       ASC``), then, for the whole page at once,
    2. one GROUP BY ``video_item.status``,
    3. one video-id read,
    4. one max(video.updated_at) read,
    5. one all-Job activity key read (max of ``updated_at``/``created_at``
       for Project- and real-Video-owned jobs of ANY state),
    6. one active-job list read (``created_at DESC, id ASC``, bounded),
    7. one active-job count read,
    8. one artifact-ownership read,
    9. one artifact-totals read,
    10. one channel-display read.
  There is no per-Project query anywhere — N+1 is impossible by
  construction (CORRECTION P1.1).
- **No join inflation.**  Video counts use a GROUP BY on ``video_item``
  (one row per video).  Artifact bytes deduplicate by Artifact id in
  Python after a single ownership join restricted to the owning
  Workspace's ``artifact`` rows, so a shared artifact owned by several
  Video Items of the same Project is counted once and another workspace's
  artifacts are never counted.
- **Polymorphic owner safety (AC5).**  Active jobs are owned by the
  Project itself or by its real Video Items only (``owner_type`` +
  ``owner_id`` membership).  Orphan owner ids, cross-workspace owners and
  terminal states are excluded by construction.
- **Capability honesty (AC4).**  ``next_action`` is derived only from the
  authoritative Video Item status set and the Project lifecycle.  No QC
  blocker, output version, ETA, or capability/system readiness is
  fabricated; unavailable future capabilities stay disabled with a
  blocker.
- **DTO boundary.**  The repository returns plain frozen dataclasses; no
  ORM instance ever crosses into the API layer (AC2).

Storage policy (AC6, CORRECTION P2.6): ``total_bytes`` sums
``size_bytes`` ONLY for ``ready`` artifacts; ``missing`` and ``trash``
artifacts are counted per state but never contribute bytes; **every**
deduplicated artifact with a ``NULL`` size (``unknown_size_count``) is
counted as unknown **regardless of its state** and excluded from the byte
total.

Global ordering (CORRECTION P1.2): page selection orders by the
authoritative ``last_activity_at`` — ``max(project.updated_at,
newest video updated_at, newest owned-Job updated_at, newest owned-Job
created_at)`` — computed BEFORE ``ORDER BY ... LIMIT/OFFSET``, then by
project id ASC on ties.  This is a global order across page boundaries:
an old Project with a newer Video or terminal Job outranks a recently
updated Project.

SQL page bounding (CORRECTION P2-R2.1): the page SELECT applies SQL
``OFFSET offset LIMIT limit+1`` AFTER the global ordering, so the
database — not Python — bounds the rows.  ``limit + 1`` is the
honest-``has_more`` probe; the extra row is never composed.

Per-Project active-job top-10 (CORRECTION P2-R2.2): the active-job list
uses a window rank partitioned by the RESOLVED Project ownership
(project id for Project-owned jobs, real Video Item id for
video_item-owned jobs, NULL for orphans) and ordered by
``created_at DESC, id ASC``; the outer SELECT keeps ``rank <= 10`` per
partition.  A Project whose jobs are all older than another page
Project's newest 10 still receives its OWN newest 10, with one constant
query for the whole page (no N+1).

Explicit read snapshot (CORRECTION P1.4): the request dependency
(``app/api/deps.get_summary_repository``) begins an explicit SQLAlchemy
read transaction (``session.begin()``) at the request boundary and
closes it with ``rollback()`` — every statement in one request observes
one SQLite snapshot.  This repository itself never commits.
